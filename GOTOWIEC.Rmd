Based on the following log-likelihood function please estimate the parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. 

```{r}
mle_pdf <- function(par, x) {
  ll <- dnorm(x = x, mean = par[1], sd = par[2], log = TRUE)
  sum(ll)
}
```

Answer the following questions:

1. does the optimization procedure converged? how do you know?  -- 15 pkt
2. what is $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$? -- 2.5 pkt
3. what are the standard errors for the estimated vector of parameters?  -- 2.5 pkt

**Code:**
Optimizing requires the maxLik package
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# (echo=FALSE just prevents all install info being printed out)

# install.packages("maxLik") <- uncomment if necessary
library(maxLik)
```
Using the maxLik package
```{r}
# 1. Make the data provided in the task into an R variable (just copy-paste)

# 2. Call the maxLik function and put the result into a variable "results"
results <- maxLik(logLik = mle_pdf, start = c(5,1), x = data, method = "NR")
# 1st argument is the log-likelihood (provided in task)
# 2nd is the starting parameters (this can be whatever we want)
# 3rd is the data provided in the task
# 4th is the method - it has to be "NR" for Newton-Rhapsod

# 3. Look at the summary of results to draw conclusions
summary(results)
# (ignore any NaNs produced warnings btw)

```
**Answers:**


1. Yes, the optimization procedure does converge. We know it, because the function returns a return code 1: gradient close to zero.
In addition, the final results remains the same no matter what starting arguments we provide - it's the same for c(0.1, 999), c(5, 1) and c(1000, 0.007) etc.


2. $\hat{\mu} = 4.05163$ and $\hat{\sigma} = 0.83513$. We know this because in the output of summary(results) we can see the estimates of the first parameter (mean) and second (std. deviation)


3. The stadard errors are 0.11810 for $\hat{\mu}$ and 0.08351 for $\hat{\sigma}$. Again, it's in the output.

Assume that we have the following data concerning the average reaction time per day (in milliseconds) for subjects in a sleep deprivation study.

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
  head(sleepstudy)
  Reaction Days Subject
1 249.5600    0     308
2 258.7047    1     308
3 250.8006    2     308
4 321.4398    3     308
5 356.8519    4     308
6 414.6901    5     308
```

where:

+ Reaction -- Average reaction time (ms)
+ Days -- Number of days of sleep deprivation
+ Subject -- Subject number on which the observation was made.

We built the following model:

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
Call:
formula = Reaction ~ Days, family = gaussian(), data = sleepstudy, id = Subject, corstr = "ar")

 Coefficients:
            Estimate Std.err    Wald Pr(>|W|)    
(Intercept)  254.230   6.485 1536.69  < 2e-16 ***
Days          10.467   1.448   52.25 4.89e-13 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Correlation structure = ar1 
Estimated Scale Parameters:

            Estimate Std.err
(Intercept)     2259   533.6
  Link = identity 

Estimated Correlation Parameters:
      Estimate Std.err
alpha   0.8536 0.05214
Number of clusters:   18  Maximum cluster size: 10 
```

Please answer the following questions:

1. what type of model we estimated? Please read carefuly the output and specify the details -- 4 pkt
2. how many subjects were in the study? -- 1 pkt
3. please explain in plain words what is the impact of variable `Days` on the target variable -- 5 pkt
4. what is the `ar1` in the model? what does `alpha` mean?  -- 5 pkt 

**Answers:**

1. This is an AR1 model, as denoted by correlation structure = ar1. It's an autoregressive linear predictive model. (mieliśmy to pod koniec na ekonometrii chyba)

2. There were 18 subjects - each subject is one cluster.

3. We can expresss the amount of time in milliseconds it would take someone to react with the following equation: $Reaction \ time = Sleepless \ days * 10.467 + 254.230$. What this means is that with each additional day of no sleeping, the reaction time of a subject is going to be 10.467ms slower.

4. AR1 is the type of model that could be created. Alpha is a measure of how much impact does an observation in one day depend on the observation in the previous day. In this case, alpha is 85% - this means that an observation on a given day is dependant on an observation made one day before.

Please use the following data `mtcars` (run `data(mtcars)`) for this study. Specify the following model linear model

$$
\text{mpg} = wt + wt^2 + cyl + am
$$

and answer the following questions:

1. please derive marginal effect for wt, i.e. $\frac{\partial \text{mpg}}{\partial \text{wt}}$ and explain what does it mean -- 5 pkt
2. please calculate marginal effects and its standard errors for the above model -- 5 pkt
3. please explain the output from the point above (interpret the results) -- 5 pkt

**Answers:**
1. The marginal effect (partial derivative) is equal to $2wt + 1$ (just take the derivative of expressions with $wt$ and treat the rest as constants).

2. We have to create a model as code first.
```{r}
our_model <- lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + I(wt^2)+ cyl + am, data = mtcars)
#lm stands for linear model and is used to construct the model itself
#1st argument is the formula (provided in exercise). pls note the use of I() - this tells R to interpret the function "as is". Without it it would break because of the ^2.
#2nd is just the data

# call the summary of our model
summary(our_model)
```
```{r}
# to calculate margins we need margins package
library(margins)
marginal_effects <- margins(our_model)

# put it into summary
summary(marginal_effects)
```


3. We took a look at different factors in cars: am (transmission, 0 = auto, 1 = manual), cyl (number of cylinders) and wt (weight in 1000lbs). We would like to know how they impact mpg (miles/gallon of fuel).
In the summary of marginal effects, we can notice the following:
- Technically, as am increases by 1, the mpg decreases by 1.1725. However, because the absolute value of AME < SE, we do not interpret this result. (0 is in the confidence interval, and p-value is large)
- As cyl increases by 1, the mpg decreases by 1.0655. SE is 0.4284, so real values deviate from model values by about 0.43.
- As wt increases by 1, the mpg decreases by 4.6438. SE is 1.0403, so real values deviate from model values by about 1.04.
